After make regress.

# cat t/logs/error_log                                                                      
[Mon Jul  2 10:39:21 2012] [notice] Initializing etag from /usr/ports/pobj/p5-Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/t/logs/etag-state
[Mon Jul  2 10:39:21 2012] [crit] (1)Operation not permitted: could not chown /usr/ports/pobj/p5-Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/t/logs/etag-state

Empty etag-state file (nobody:nobody) causes httpd -u to fail to start.

If I run as root:

/usr/sbin/httpd -u  -d /usr/ports/pobj/p5-Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/t -f /usr/ports/pobj/p5-Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/Apache-AuthCookie-3.14/t/conf/httpd.conf -D APACHE1 

after using make regress (or make test in pobj), httpd starts and etag-state gets values.
make regress then passes all tests.

How should I get this to happen in first place without manually stepping into regress process?
