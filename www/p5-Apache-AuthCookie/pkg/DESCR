Apache::AuthCookie intercepts first unauthenticated access to a
protected document. The user is presented with a custom form to
enter authentication credentials. The credentials are posted to
the server where AuthCookie verifies them and returns a session key
to the user's browser as a cookie. As a cookie, the browser will
pass the session key on every subsequent access. AuthCookie will
verify the session key and re-authenticate the user.
